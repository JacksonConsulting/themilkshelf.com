Welcome to The Milk Shelf where we match mamas in need and donors with local Freezer Moms in their area for milk donation and milk pick up. To help alleviate some of the stress and heartbreak of seeking milk, mamas will be notified when a Freezer in their area has milk for pick up. In addition to services for those in need, donors will also be notified when a Freezer near them has space for storage.
This page is here to provide relief and safe storage for every mama who would like to donate, or receive milk. People seeking milk will be added to the group so that they can receive notifications, and donors can have the choice of donating anonymously or publicly, and will be added to the group upon request.
When added please state whether you are a donor, donee, or wanting to be a Freezer Mom. Please add your general location so that we can start organizing Freezers, supply, and demand! Also, turn on your notification settings for this group so you can remain updated on all of the information!
Since this is a nonprofit group based on donation, we would like to encourage mamas who receive milk to donate lay flat storage bags to their Freezer Mama location so that the mamas donating can have more bags to donate their milk with. This is not something that you have to do, but it would be greatly appreciated.
Anyone who would like to donate freezer space can also be added to the group and will need to fill out a location form and days and times that pick ups and drop off will work for them. They can also have a set up by appointment schedule as well.
Each donor will be given a private donor number upon donation and will need to fill out a form that is signed stating that their milk is safe for donation. The form will include questions about diet, and medications being taken as well as possible communicable diseases.
Each Donee recipient will also fill out a form that states that they are taking the milk of their own risk and that the donor will not be held liable. The donee form will also include questions about what type of milk you need and your location.
Together we can streamline the process of milk donation and create a better way to help mamas donate and receive breastmilk.
